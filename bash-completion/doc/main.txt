Preface
=======
Bash completion extends bashs standard completion behavior to achieve
complex command lines with just a few keystrokes.  This project was
conceived to produce programmable completion routines for the most
common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the amount of typing sysadmins
and programmers need to do on a daily basis.
